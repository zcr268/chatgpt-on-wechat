"""Ambient runtime identity: who the current work is being done for.

Everything downstream of message routing needs to know which Agent, which end
user, which session and which task it is running under. Threading that through
every call site is what makes multi-agent refactors expensive, so it lives in a
ContextVar instead: routing resolves it once at the entry point, leaf code
reads it and never re-derives it.

ContextVars do not cross thread boundaries on their own. Work handed to another
thread must go through ``submit`` or ``wrap`` below, which copy the calling
context into the worker.
