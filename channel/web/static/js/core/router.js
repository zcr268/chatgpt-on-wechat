/* Address-bar routing: mirrors the current view and tab into the URL path, so
   a reload lands where the user left off and Back/Forward move between views.
   These are classic scripts sharing one global scope; see

// =====================================================================
// Routing
// =====================================================================
// A route names a view and, for the views that have tabs, one of its tabs:
// /settings, /settings/models. Only a tab that is not the view's default gets
// a segment, so the path carries what distinguishes it and nothing else.
// Deeper state -- which session is open, which file the editor holds --
// deliberately stays out. It is already restored from localStorage, and
// putting it in the URL would rewrite the address bar on every click in the
// session list.
//
// The view a route names is not always the view's internal id. /settings is
// the config view, because /config is the backend's config API, which this
// console and the desktop client both call. /scheduler is the tasks view: it
// is what the backend calls this feature already (/api/scheduler/...), and it
// leaves /tasks free for the separate notion of a task. web_channel.py serves
// these paths from the same shell; the table there has to stay in step.
