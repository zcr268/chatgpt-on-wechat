"""Resolve which channel instances to run, bridging legacy and multi-instance.

A legacy install configures channels through ``channel_type`` (a list of type
names) plus flat credentials in ``config.json``; every type maps to exactly one
running channel bound to the default Agent. This is the "shared by default"
world and must keep working untouched.

A multi-Agent install opts in by adding ``channel_instances`` to ``team.json``:
a list of records, each with its own ``instance_id``, ``channel_type``, the
``agent_id`` it routes to, and its own ``credentials``. Several records may
share a ``channel_type`` (e.g. two Feishu bots), which is exactly what a team of
independent AI employees needs.

``resolve_channel_instances`` returns a uniform list of :class:`ChannelInstance`
for both worlds, so the launcher never branch on which config style is in play. When ``channel_instances`` is absent it synthesizes one
instance per legacy ``channel_type`` with no credential override, i.e. the old
behavior byte-for-byte.
