"""A sub agent must not reset the parent run's engaged fallback.

The fallback is sticky for a whole run: once the primary model has failed a turn
for good, the remaining steps stay on the backup instead of re-probing a
provider we already know is down. It is cleared once, at the top of a run.

That breaks when the parent delegates. A sub agent is built with
``model=parent.model`` — the *same* ``AgentLLMModel`` object, not a copy — and
its ``run_stream`` runs that same reset at its top. The child therefore clears
the fallback the parent is currently relying on: when the child returns, the
parent goes back to the primary model that just failed and burns the full retry
budget again on every remaining step. The child loses the backup too, since it
is running inside the same outage and starts on the dead primary itself.

The reset has to be scoped to a *top-level* run: an outer scope that already set
a run id means this run is nested and must leave the parent's routing alone.
