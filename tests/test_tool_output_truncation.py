"""Truncation metadata for oversized tool output.

`truncate_tail` relabelled a byte cut as `"lines"` whenever the kept output
happened to fill `max_lines`, so one over-long line reported
`truncated_by == "lines"` while also reporting `last_line_partial=True` and
`output_bytes == max_bytes`. Callers pick their notice off `truncated_by`
(agent/tools/bash/bash.py), so the model was told "showing lines X-Y" for
output that had actually been cut in the middle of a line.
