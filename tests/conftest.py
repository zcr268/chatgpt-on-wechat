"""Keep the suite out of the developer's real workspace.

Whatever a test loads config for, ``agent_workspace`` ends up pointing at the
directory the person running the suite actually uses, and anything that resolves
a path without pinning one down writes there: the memory files, the scheduler
store and the tmp directory are all reachable that way.

Only that one key is redirected, and only for the session. Loading the config
outright would be worse than the problem: tests would inherit the developer's
model, language and channel settings, and start passing or failing on them.
