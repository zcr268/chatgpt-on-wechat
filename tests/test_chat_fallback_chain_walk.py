"""The executor must walk the whole chain, one attempt per link.

These drive ``_call_llm_stream`` for real (with a stubbed transport) rather
than the model's ``use_fallback``, because the two behaviors that matter live
in the executor: that a failing link advances to the next one instead of
ending the turn, and that a link gets *one* attempt rather than the primary's
full retry budget.

The single-attempt rule is what keeps a chain usable: with the primary's
backoff (30s+ per rate-limited retry) a three-link chain would sleep past the
web channel's SSE idle timeout before the last link was even tried, and the
user would see a dropped connection instead of a reply.
