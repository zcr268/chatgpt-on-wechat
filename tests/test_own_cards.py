"""A tool that draws its own cards should not also get the generic one.

The loop puts up a card for every tool call. A tool running several units of
work at once puts up a card per unit, and the generic card then repeats all of
them at once: every unit's arguments run together in its input, every unit's
output run together in its result. `renders_own_cards` lets such a call opt out
of the generic card - but only for as long as it actually draws its own, since
a refusal that draws nothing has to be visible somewhere.
