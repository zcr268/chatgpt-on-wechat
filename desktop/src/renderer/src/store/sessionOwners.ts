/**
 * Which Agent owns which conversation.
 *
 * A conversation is stored in exactly one Agent's workspace: its history,
 * settings and title all live there, and every request about it must name that
 * Agent or the backend answers from the default Agent's (empty) copy. The
 * backend tells us the owner of every persisted session (`session.agent`), but
 * a brand-new chat exists only on this client until its first message, so the
 * owner is remembered here — in localStorage, so a restart mid-draft (or before
 * the roster has loaded) still knows who the open conversation belongs to.
 *
 * Kept free of store imports so both the agent store and the session store can
 * consult it without a cycle. Single-Agent installs never write to it: an
 * unknown owner means "the default Agent", exactly the legacy behavior.
