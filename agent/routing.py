"""Deterministic inbound routing for agent workspaces.

Routing is driven entirely by channel instances: each running channel carries
the id of the Agent it is bound to (``bound_agent_id`` in the message context,
sourced from ``channel_instances[].agent_id``). There is no separate binding
table — the instance that received a message decides which Agent answers it,
and an explicit per-message ``agent_id`` (e.g. a console request) overrides it.
Anything unrouted falls back to the default Agent.
