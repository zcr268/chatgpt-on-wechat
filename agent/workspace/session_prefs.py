"""Per-session runtime preferences: which model answers, what it may change.

Sibling of :mod:`agent.workspace.project_store`, same shape and same key scheme.
A conversation can pin its own model and its own permission mode; anything not
pinned follows the global settings, so an untouched session keeps behaving the
way the instance is configured.

Why a JSON file rather than the sessions table: the web UI mints a session id in
the browser and a row only appears once the first message is persisted. A user
who picks a model before typing must have somewhere to put it, and this store
has no foreign key to satisfy.

Stored under ``<shared_root>/session_prefs.json``::

    {
      "sessions": {
        "default::session_abc": {
          "provider": "claudeAPI",
          "model": "claude-sonnet-5",
          "permission": "workspace-write",
          "ts": 1731999999.0
        }
      }
    }

Every field is optional. Absent means "follow the global setting".
